---------------------------------------------------------------

In this 2 player game, a coin will be tossed to decide which player
goes first. If it lands on Heads, Player 1 will go first, and if it 
lands on Tails, Player 2 will go first. Which ever player goes first
decides if they want to use an X or an O. 
After the game, the players will have a chance to play again if they
choose to. If they opt out, the score will be displayed.
